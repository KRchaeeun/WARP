3. Receive decade and genre data and navigate to the movie recommendation page.  
![preferencesurvey](./img/preference%20survey.gif)  

<br>

- This is the function of aggregating and displaying movie data:
```python
# Counting the number of movies per year
movies_per_year = (
    Movie.objects.annotate(year=ExtractYear("release_date"))
    .values("year")
    .annotate(count=Count("id"))
    .order_by("year")
)

for entry in movies_per_year:
    print(f"Year: {entry['year']}, Count: {entry['count']}")

# Counting the number of movies per year
# Aggregating the number of movies in increments of 10 years
movies_per_decade = (
    Movie.objects.annotate(decade=ExtractYear("release_date") / 10 * 10)
    .values("decade")
    .annotate(count=Count("id"))
    .order_by("decade")
)

for entry in movies_per_decade:
    print(f"Decade: {int(entry['decade'])}s, Count: {entry['count']}")
```
 
<br>  
 
### Provide a List of Recommended Movies  
1. Recommend movies based on the preference survey.  
2. Provide trailer videos for the recommended movies.  
3. Recommend 10 masterpieces and 10 hidden gems separately; masterpieces are recommended based on ratings, while hidden gems are high-rated but lesser-known movies.  
![providelist](./img/provide%20list.gif)
 
<br>

- This is the hidden movie recommendation function:
```python
# hidden movie recommendation function
def recommend_hidden_movies(request):
    # Retrieve a list of years (default is all years)
    years = request.GET.getlist("year")  # Receives multiple years as a list
    if not years:
        years = Movie.objects.dates("release_date", "year").values_list(
            "release_date__year", flat=True
        )

    expanded_years = []
    for year in years:
        if year.endswith("s"):
            for i in range(0, 10):
                expanded_years.append(f"{year[:-2]}{i}")
        else:
            expanded_years.append(year)

    # Retrieve a list of genres (default is all genres)
    genres = request.GET.getlist("genre")  # Receives multiple genres as a list
    print(expanded_years)
    if not genres:
        genres = Genre.objects.values_list("name", flat=True)

    # Extract the popularity values as a list
    popularity_values = list(Movie.objects.values_list("popularity", flat=True))

    # Use numpy to calculate the 50th percentile
    percentile_50 = np.percentile(popularity_values, 50)
    # Calculate the average value of the vote_average field
    average_vote = Movie.objects.aggregate(Avg("vote_average"))["vote_average__avg"]

    # Set the basic query
    query = Movie.objects.filter(
        release_date__year__in=expanded_years,  # Year filter
        popularity__lte=percentile_50,          # Less than or equal to 50th percentile in popularity
        vote_average__gte=average_vote,         # Greater than or equal to the average vote
    ).order_by("-vote_average")

    # Apply genre filter
    if genres:
        query = query.filter(genres__name__in=genres).distinct()

    recommended_movies = query[:10]

    serializer = MovieListSerializer(recommended_movies, many=True)
    return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
```

<br>

- This is the movie recommendation function:
``` python
# recommendation function
def recommend_movies(request):
    # Retrieve a list of years (default is all years)
    years = request.GET.getlist("year")  # Receives multiple years as a list
    if not years:
        years = Movie.objects.dates("release_date", "year").values_list(
            "release_date__year", flat=True
        )

    expanded_years = []
    for year in years:
        if year.endswith("s"):
            for i in range(0, 10):
                expanded_years.append(f"{year[:-2]}{i}")
        else:
            expanded_years.append(year)

    # Retrieve a list of genres (default is all genres)
    genres = request.GET.getlist("genre")  # Receives multiple genres as a list

    if not genres:
        genres = Genre.objects.values_list("name", flat=True)

    average_vote = Movie.objects.aggregate(Avg("vote_average"))["vote_average__avg"]

    # Set the basic query
    query = Movie.objects.filter(
        release_date__year__in=expanded_years,  # Year filter
        vote_average__gte=average_vote,         # Filter for movies with average vote greater than or equal to the average
    ).order_by("-popularity")

    # Apply genre filter
    if genres:
        query = query.filter(genres__name__in=genres).distinct()

    recommended_movies = query[:10]

    serializer = MovieListSerializer(recommended_movies, many=True)
    return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
```

<br>

![starrating](./img/star%20rating.gif)
 
<br>  
 
### Search  
1. Search is conducted through a modal window.
2. Entering a word in the search bar provides a list of movies containing that word in their title.
3. Clicking on a movie navigates to its detailed page.
4. When there are multiple movies, scrolling is possible within the modal.  
![search](./img/search.gif)
  
<br>

- This is the modal design for the search:
```js  
.modal {
  overflow-y: auto;
  max-height: 100%;
}

/* Elements for search on the home screen (not functional, only used for displaying the modal) */
#home-search {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  margin-bottom: 80px;
}

#home-search-box input {
  font-family: 'NanumSquareNeo-Variable';
  outline: none;
  border: none;
  border-bottom: white solid;
  background-color: #ffffff00;
  color: white;
}

#home-search-box input:hover {
  border-bottom: gray solid;
  transition: all 0.2s;
  transform: scale(1.03);
}

#home-search-box img {
  width: 35px;
  margin-right: 10px;
}

/* Elements inside the search modal */
#search-modal {
  z-index: 10;
  position: fixed;
  top: 0px;
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vw;
}

#search-modal-search {
  z-index: 20;
  width: 100%;
  position: fixed;
  top: 30px;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  flex-direction: column;
  flex-wrap: nowrap;
}

#search-modal-search-box {
  z-index: 30;
  margin-top: 50px;
}

#search-modal-search-box input {
  font-family: 'NanumSquareNeo-Variable';
  outline: none;
  border: none;
  border-bottom: white solid;
  background-color: #ffffff00;
  color: white;
}

#search-modal-search-box input:hover {
  transition: all 0.2s;
  transform: scale(1.03);
}

#search-modal-search-box img {
  width: 35px;
  margin-right: 10px;
}

#search-modal-result {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 900px;
  z-index: 30;
}

/* Background animation */
#search-modal-bg {
  z-index: 10;
  position: fixed;
  top: 0px;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: #222222b0;
  backdrop-filter: blur(20px);
}

button {
  color: rgba(116, 116, 116, 0);
}
```

<br>

### Community Filtering  
1. Display the list number, title, author, time of creation, and the number of likes.
2. Provide two display formats (by likes, by recency) as buttons: Display posts in order of likes, Display posts in order of most recent creation.  
![community1](./img/community1.gif)
 
<br>

- This is the filtering function from Vue.js:
```js
// Currently selected sorting method
const currentSort = ref('latest')

// Computed property for sorting the list of posts
const sortedPosts = computed(() => {
  return posts.value.slice().sort((a, b) => {
    if (currentSort.value === 'latest') {
      // Sort by most recent date
      return new Date(b.created_at) - new Date(a.created_at)
    } else if (currentSort.value === 'likes') {
      // Sort by number of likes
      return b.likes_count - a.likes_count
    }
    return 0
  })
})
```  

<br>
