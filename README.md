    Movie.objects.annotate(year=ExtractYear("release_date"))
    .values("year")
    .annotate(count=Count("id"))
    .order_by("year")
)

for entry in movies_per_year:
    print(f"Year: {entry['year']}, Count: {entry['count']}")

# Counting the number of movies per year
# Aggregating the number of movies in increments of 10 years
movies_per_decade = (
    Movie.objects.annotate(decade=ExtractYear("release_date") / 10 * 10)
    .values("decade")
    .annotate(count=Count("id"))
    .order_by("decade")
)

for entry in movies_per_decade:
    print(f"Decade: {int(entry['decade'])}s, Count: {entry['count']}")
```
 
<br>

        years = Movie.objects.dates("release_date", "year").values_list(
            "release_date__year", flat=True
        )

    expanded_years = []
    for year in years:
        if year.endswith("s"):
            for i in range(0, 10):
                expanded_years.append(f"{year[:-2]}{i}")
        else:
            expanded_years.append(year)

    # Retrieve a list of genres (default is all genres)
    genres = request.GET.getlist("genre")  # Receives multiple genres as a list
    print(expanded_years)
    if not genres:
        genres = Genre.objects.values_list("name", flat=True)

    # Extract the popularity values as a list
    popularity_values = list(Movie.objects.values_list("popularity", flat=True))

    # Use numpy to calculate the 50th percentile
    percentile_50 = np.percentile(popularity_values, 50)
    # Calculate the average value of the vote_average field
    average_vote = Movie.objects.aggregate(Avg("vote_average"))["vote_average__avg"]

    # Set the basic query
    query = Movie.objects.filter(
        release_date__year__in=expanded_years,  # Year filter
        popularity__lte=percentile_50,          # Less than or equal to 50th percentile in popularity
        vote_average__gte=average_vote,         # Greater than or equal to the average vote
    ).order_by("-vote_average")

    # Apply genre filter
    if genres:
        query = query.filter(genres__name__in=genres).distinct()

    recommended_movies = query[:10]

    serializer = MovieListSerializer(recommended_movies, many=True)
    return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
```

<br>

- This is the movie recommendation function:
``` python
# recommendation function
def recommend_movies(request):
    # Retrieve a list of years (default is all years)
    years = request.GET.getlist("year")  # Receives multiple years as a list
    if not years:
        years = Movie.objects.dates("release_date", "year").values_list(

3. Clicking on a movie navigates to its detailed page.
4. When there are multiple movies, scrolling is possible within the modal.  
![search](./img/search.gif)
  
<br>

- This is the modal design for the search:
```js  
.modal {
  overflow-y: auto;
  max-height: 100%;
}

/* Elements for search on the home screen (not functional, only used for displaying the modal) */
#home-search {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  margin-bottom: 80px;
}

#home-search-box input {
  font-family: 'NanumSquareNeo-Variable';
  outline: none;
  border: none;
  border-bottom: white solid;
  background-color: #ffffff00;
  color: white;
}

#home-search-box input:hover {
  border-bottom: gray solid;
  transition: all 0.2s;
  transform: scale(1.03);
}

#home-search-box img {
  width: 35px;
  margin-right: 10px;
}

/* Elements inside the search modal */
#search-modal {
  z-index: 10;
  position: fixed;
  top: 0px;
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vw;
}

#search-modal-search {
  z-index: 20;
  width: 100%;
  position: fixed;
  top: 30px;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  flex-direction: column;
  flex-wrap: nowrap;
}

#search-modal-search-box {
  z-index: 30;
  margin-top: 50px;
}

#search-modal-search-box input {
  font-family: 'NanumSquareNeo-Variable';
  outline: none;
  border: none;
  border-bottom: white solid;
  background-color: #ffffff00;
  color: white;
}

#search-modal-search-box input:hover {
  transition: all 0.2s;
  transform: scale(1.03);
}

#search-modal-search-box img {
  width: 35px;
  margin-right: 10px;
}

#search-modal-result {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 900px;
  z-index: 30;
}

/* Background animation */
#search-modal-bg {
  z-index: 10;
  position: fixed;
  top: 0px;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: #222222b0;
  backdrop-filter: blur(20px);
}

button {
  color: rgba(116, 116, 116, 0);
}
```

<br>

### Community Filtering  
1. Display the list number, title, author, time of creation, and the number of likes.
2. Provide two display formats (by likes, by recency) as buttons: Display posts in order of likes, Display posts in order of most recent creation.  
![community1](./img/community1.gif)
 
<br>

- This is the filtering function from Vue.js:
```js
// Currently selected sorting method
const currentSort = ref('latest')

// Computed property for sorting the list of posts
const sortedPosts = computed(() => {
  return posts.value.slice().sort((a, b) => {
    if (currentSort.value === 'latest') {
      // Sort by most recent date
      return new Date(b.created_at) - new Date(a.created_at)
    } else if (currentSort.value === 'likes') {
      // Sort by number of likes
      return b.likes_count - a.likes_count
    }
    return 0
  })
})
```  

<br>

## Thoughts on the Project üçª  

Lessons Learned from this Project:
Through this project, I gained a profound understanding of the importance of effective version control using Git and strategic branch management. The experience of collaborating through pull requests and merges, and resolving code conflicts was immensely educational. Utilizing Django, I designed database models and developed RESTful APIs for frontend-backend communication, realizing the significance of user authentication and permission management. In frontend development with Vue.js, I leveraged Vue components and Vue Router to construct a Single Page Application (SPA) structure and implemented state management using Vuex. This approach significantly enhanced the responsive web design and user interaction elements of the project.

New Skills Acquired:
In backend development with Django, I newly adopted the dj_rest_auth library to implement user authentication features. I set up URL paths for critical authentication functionalities like user login, logout, and password changes, integrating dj_rest_auth URLs into the Django project's URL configurations for efficient authentication handling. Additionally, to ensure project security, sensitive configuration details, such as API keys, were managed via .env files to prevent exposure in public repositories like GitLab or GitHub. In frontend development with Vue.js, the introduction of the typed.js library added dynamic text animation effects, enriching the user experience and enhancing website interactivity.

Challenges Faced:
The most significant challenge in this first project was dividing front-end and back-end tasks among three team members. This led to numerous errors and complex code, requiring considerable time for problem-solving. As beginners in project development, we spent a lot of time identifying and resolving issues, often struggling to fully understand the principles behind the codes found through Google searches. This experience underscored the importance of systematic collaboration and code management in future projects.

Project Reflections:
Although I put considerable effort into producing a high-quality output, I felt a sense of disappointment with the final product, given the constrained timeframe of 10 days. My professor advised focusing on more prominent, visible features rather than on smaller details. However, I found myself spending too much time on minor aspects, resulting in an inability to fully develop significant features, leading to a less satisfactory outcome. In future projects, I plan to focus initially on implementing standout features, leaving detailed implementations for later stages to achieve more satisfying results.

These experiences have provided me with invaluable lessons in teamwork, project management, and technical skills, laying a solid foundation for my growth as a more professional and effective developer.
